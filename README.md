# ⭐ Btr Studio Layout (BSL)

In the new "Next-Gen" Roblox Studio UI, Roblox allows for creation of new tabs and items in those tabs for some weird reason they just don't include some important items in the avaliable items list (Part dropdown, Part grid, Part rotation, etc) making it very inconvenient, on top of the new UI just having the weirdest layout ever it causes annoyances.

I dispise the new UI so much to the point I've spent hours coding in JSON to change every tab, and the items in the tab to match old Roblox Studio UI. This isn't a 1:1 recreation since Roblox limitations but it's pretty close 👍

# 📕 How To Use

**(For Windows) Step-by-step:**

1. Download ```bsl.zip``` from repository
2. Search ```%localappdata%``` in your searchbar
3. Find your ```Roblox``` folder
4. Open the folder and find your **Roblox UserID** (a string of numbers)
5. In that folder open ```CustomRibbonTabs```
6. Drag and drop all JSON files from ```bsl.zip``` into ```CustomRibbonTabs``` (just a warning this might mess with your own created custom tabs)
7. You're done 👍
